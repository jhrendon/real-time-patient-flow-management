As hospitals deal with increasing number of patients, they look for technologies to enhance the efficiency of their operations. A key measure of hospital efficiency is patients wait time.

This project attempts to seemly provide insights on current operations at hospitals without interfering with stakeholders' activities. This system provides a mechanism to monitor patients flow through clinical pathways in real time.

To achieve the goal of monitoring patients, without interfering with nurses or physicians, the system relies on the knowledge of locations of patients, nurses, and physicians. The system intelligently correlates this information with the clinical pathways identified for each patient.

The system provides dashboards that show patients states, progress, and current wait time in real time. The system also provides location aware services to care professionals. For example, a patient chart automatically pops out on the care professional portable device when the professional is physically close to the concerned patient.

Such system can be used to track health care assets and enhance utilization of such often expensive scarce resources.
